## pact coordination protocol

pact coordinates multiple coding agents working in this repository. Follow
this protocol whenever you touch shared files or hand off work to others.

- **Identity**: your agent identity comes from the `PACT_AGENT` environment
  variable (or `--agent <name>`). Set one before running pact commands; pact
  never guesses an identity. `pact whoami` shows the identity and paths it
  resolved.
- **Also export `BEADS_ACTOR=$PACT_AGENT`, once, in the same shell.** pact
  writes nothing to bd, so nothing pact runs can attribute your task tracking
  for you: `bd ready`/`bd update --claim`/`bd close` are yours alone. Without
  this they fall through to bd's next attribution tier — your shared checkout's
  `git user.name` — so a 15-agent fleet's entire task-tracking history can
  attribute to one identity while `.pact/events.jsonl` correctly shows sixteen.
  `pact whoami` prints the exact line to run.
- **Announce intent before you research, not just before you write.** Your
  first pact commands come *before* you read the first file: `pact msg inbox`
  and `pact lease ls` to see what is already claimed and by whom, then
  `pact lease acquire <path>... --note "<what you are doing and why>"` for the
  files you expect to own. Several paths in one `acquire` are taken
  all-or-nothing, so you never end up holding half of what you need while a
  peer holds the rest. Do it even if you will only be reading for the next ten
  minutes. Why: a peer planning against the same file can renegotiate now
  instead of at the end, when both plans are sunk cost — and a fleet that has
  announced nothing looks exactly like a fleet that crashed on startup.
- **The lease note IS the announcement — do not also message it.** `pact log`
  already records every acquire, renew, release and expiry with its note, and
  `pact ui` shows that live, so a human watching already sees what you claimed
  and why. A message saying "starting on src/foo.rs" duplicates a record that
  wrote itself.
  **Send a message when you need something back**: a decision, a file you do
  not own, a warning about a contract you changed. Not to report progress.
  Measured on one fleet: 85 messages, 41 of them status pings to `human`, and
  an inbox nobody could triage — which is how a real `BLOCKER` message sat
  unread for 38 minutes in the middle of it.
- **Lease anything you WRITE, not just files you edit.** A lease is on a path,
  so a directory of shared state is leasable too — `pact lease acquire .beads/
  --note "running bd against the shared store"` before you run a tool that might
  write there. An agent that had correctly leased both source files it edited
  still corrupted the shared Beads store, because it read the protocol as being
  about editing files and a CLI wrote a second database behind it at exit 0.
  pact itself never writes to `.beads/`; the commands you run directly do.
- **If you are the ORCHESTRATOR, this file is addressed to you too.** You have no
  bead, no wave and no claim, so every rule here reads as somebody else's — and
  you are the participant with the broadest write access: shared skeletons,
  pre-wiring, merges, checkpoints. Lease the skeleton before you write it. On one
  20-agent run `pact audit --check commit-correlation` found 12 commits no hold
  covered and every one was the orchestrator's, breaking the rule it had written
  into all 16 workers' prompts — which all 16 followed. `--allow-main` excuses you
  from `--check topology`, not from holding leases. And read the handoffs for the
  beads your skeleton serves (`pact msg thread bead:<id>`) before you write it:
  they are addressed to a bead, not to you, so no inbox will hand them over.
- **Ownership, and its one carve-out, stated together**: lease every file you
  edit that another agent might also touch, and release it when done. The
  single exception is a file that is yours alone by assignment (your own
  evidence log, your own scratch dir) — nobody else writes it, so it needs no
  lease. Anything else: lease it. Leases are advisory, not enforced by the
  filesystem; respect them anyway.
- **Let it all go when you are done**: the default lease is 45 minutes; for
  genuinely longer work, acquire with `--ttl` or `pact lease renew <path>`. That
  default is measured, not guessed — `pact audit` put the p90 hold at 24 minutes
  and the longest ever at 36, against one renewal in the entire history. So most
  work never needs to think about the TTL at all. `pact lease release <path>`
  frees one file, `pact lease release --all` frees everything you hold in a
  single call, so nothing gets half-forgotten. Release before you report
  yourself finished, not after — but **commit before you release**. A lease
  released while the work is still uncommitted breaks the one binding the log
  exists to prove; measured on a 20-agent build, a fix landed 99 seconds after
  its author had already let the file go, and `pact audit --check
  commit-correlation` reports it as a commit nobody held a lease for.
- **Ask whose file it is before you touch it, and hand it back by name**:
  `pact agents --for <path>` names the last agent to act on a path even after
  they released it and exited, and `pact lease acquire` tells you the same
  thing unprompted. When you need something from that agent, address the FILE,
  not the name: `pact msg send --to-owner-of <path> "..."`. A path outlives the
  process that held it, so a handoff sent to a path still reaches whoever picks
  it up next; one sent to an agent that has finished is a dead letter.
- **A message about a file follows the file.** `pact msg send --to-owner-of
  <path>` does not just look up a name — the message is tagged with the path,
  and whoever leases that path next is told it is waiting, even if the agent it
  resolved to has exited. So when you are handing off work, address the FILE.
  And read what `pact lease acquire` tells you before you edit: a message
  waiting on a path is usually the reason the last agent stopped.
  **Someone must have held it first.** pact resolves `--to-owner-of` through the
  record of who has leased the path, so a path nobody has ever leased has no
  owner to address and the send is refused outright. You cannot pre-address work
  that has not started — for that, name the agent with `--to`.
- **On exit 2, wait INSIDE the command: `pact lease acquire <path> --wait <dur>`.**
  It blocks until the path is free and returns the moment it is, so you never end
  your turn to wait. That matters more than it sounds: if you are a subagent, your
  process IS your turn loop, and ending a turn to wait for a notification is the
  same as exiting — nothing can re-enter you. Measured on one 12-agent fleet, seven
  agents took the old advice to "subscribe and pick up other work", four never
  resumed at all, and the three that did resumed nine hours later within fourteen
  seconds of each other, because a human woke the parent session. One of them was
  holding four finished, tested, committed fixes.
  **`pact watch add <path>` is still right when you genuinely have other work
  first** and will still be running to receive the diff. It is not a way to wait.
  **Never poll by re-running the command yourself.** That spends a turn per
  attempt and is what `pact audit --check retry-storm` counts: one fleet retried
  every 15 seconds, 33 times, against a median 355 seconds of remaining hold, and
  24 refusals in that run came from agents that had ALREADY subscribed and polled
  anyway.
- **A path someone else holds exits 2** — branch on that, not on the message
  text. `pact lease ls` names the holder; message them and pick up something
  else, which is what announcing early bought you. `pact lease acquire --steal`
  and `pact lease release --force` do override a live claim, but both warn on
  stderr and name the agent they displaced: reach for them when you know a peer
  is gone, not when you are impatient with one who isn't.
- **Announce contract changes**: if you change an API, schema, CLI flag, or
  any other contract another agent depends on, message them:
  `pact msg send --to <agent> "what changed and why"`. Check the recipient
  exists with `pact agents` first — a mistyped name sends into the void. One
  decision that affects several agents goes out as ONE message: repeat `--to`
  and they all land in a single thread anyone can read and reply into.
- **Use a file for anything longer than a sentence**: `--body-file <path>`.
  Quotes, backslashes and aligned tables do not survive a shell, and handing
  over an API is exactly that kind of content.
- **Read and reply in the same thread**: `pact msg inbox` lists one line per
  message; `pact msg read <id>` shows one in full together with its whole
  thread. Reply with `pact msg send --to <sender> --thread <id> "..."` — a
  reply sent without `--thread` starts a new thread, and the exchange stops
  being readable as one conversation.
- **Confirm, don't re-send**: `pact msg sent` shows what you sent and whether
  the recipient has read it. If you are unsure a message went out, check
  there — a blind re-send is how a peer's inbox fills with duplicates.
- **Subscribe to the interfaces you depend on but do not own.** At task start,
  `pact watch add <path>` (a file, or a directory for everything under it) for
  every file whose contract your work assumes. When its holder releases it,
  pact sends you the diff of what they changed — automatically, as part of
  their `lease release`. Nobody has to remember to tell you. This exists
  because they demonstrably will not: across three fleet runs since the
  protocol started reserving messages for what needs something back, 28 agents
  sent 4 messages between them, and the one that mattered was the only reason a
  runtime panic did not ship.
  **In a worktree fleet a notice is a contract notice, not a code delivery.** It
  names the branch the change is on; that change cannot appear in your tree until
  the branch merges and you merge that. Read the diff for what the contract now
  says and keep going — waiting for the file to change under you is waiting for
  something that structurally cannot happen.
- **Read your inbox at task start AND before your final commit.** The first
  tells you what changed under you before you plan; the second catches the
  interface change that landed while you were working, which is exactly when it
  is cheapest to absorb and most expensive to miss.
- **If you act on a message, mark it read.** `pact msg read <id>` is the only
  thing that tells the sender their warning landed; act on one without it and
  their `pact msg sent` says "undelivered" forever, which is indistinguishable
  from being ignored. Across two fleet builds, three of four messages were
  never acknowledged by the agent they were addressed to — including one that
  prevented a runtime panic. `pact audit --export` lists the stragglers.
- **A red shared branch is NEVER a reason to hold a finished merge.**
  `pact merge --verify` asks whether YOUR merge added a failure, not whether the
  branch is green. Arriving to a branch that is already failing for somebody
  else's reason, it lands your work anyway, says so, and releases the mutex; only
  a failure your merge introduced is reverted, and only then does it keep the
  mutex. So merge when your work is done and proven, and let pact decide which of
  those two happened.
  This rule is here — in the block `pact init` syncs into every repository —
  rather than in one fleet's own notes, because that is where it was and it cost
  a run. Four agents in one 12-agent fleet independently held finished, tested,
  committed work off a red master, each citing the mechanic correctly: *"merging
  now would falsely go red due to their unrelated unfixed bug"*. They were not
  defying the rule; the rule did not exist yet where they could read it. It was
  written 38 minutes after the first of them parked, and reached the NEXT
  cohort's spawn prompt only. One of those four was holding four finished fixes,
  two of them repaired regressions.
- **Gates are beads, and they are visible in `bd` like any other.** Before you
  claim into a new wave, check that the prior wave's gates have closed. pact will
  not stop you — no acquire is ever refused on gate grounds — but `pact audit
  --check gate-order` reads the ledger either way, and a start it finds ahead of a
  gate is a question somebody will ask afterwards.
- **Read your inheritance before you start a claimed bead**: `pact msg thread
  bead:<id>`. Whoever finished what yours depends on may have left findings there
  — addressed to the bead rather than to you, because when they wrote it you did
  not exist yet. It is usually the cheapest thing you will read all session.
- **When you close a bead that has dependents, send a handoff**: `pact handoff
  <bead> --confidence high|medium|low --findings "<what you found>"`. Findings you
  would want waiting for you. It never blocks and nothing waits on it; a bead with
  nothing worth saying should send nothing.
- **Orient with `pact log`**: one chronological feed of who leased what and
  who said what. Read it when you join, and when you need to know whether a
  peer is still moving.
- **The coordination logs are committed from the MAIN checkout, not from your
  worktree.** `.pact/events.jsonl` and `.pact/messages.jsonl` are the two things pact
  stores that it cannot derive from anything else — who held what, and what agents
  said to each other — so they do belong in git. But under the default shared scope
  every worktree resolves state to the main checkout, so from a worktree your copy of
  those files is a stale tracked snapshot and `git add` finds nothing to stage.
  **If you are working in a worktree, do not try to commit them.** Whoever owns the
  main checkout — usually the orchestrator — commits them for the whole fleet, and a
  missed one is self-healing on the next commit.
  This sentence used to say "commit both when you commit your work", and 35 agents in
  one run each spent time discovering that it is impossible to follow from where they
  were standing; nine reported it independently and unprompted.
  `.pact/leases/`, `.pact/waits/` and `.pact/read/` stay local everywhere — live
  runtime state and per-machine read positions, and committing those would have you
  fighting over peers' in-flight claims and inboxes.
- **Sign your commits with your agent name**: `git commit --trailer
  Pact-Agent=$PACT_AGENT`. Every agent in a fleet commits under the same git
  identity, so `git log` cannot say which of you made a change — and without
  that, `pact audit --check commit-correlation` can only ask whether ANYONE held
  a path when a commit landed, never whether the agent that made it did. Measured:
  one agent working with no leases at all had its worst commit (five files, all of
  them leased by compliant peers at that moment) pass the check clean, because a
  hold existed. The better everyone else behaves, the better an unleased commit
  hides. One flag makes it visible.
- **Three git commands take a target you did not name — do not use them in a
  shared checkout.** A fleet shares one index and one HEAD, and each of these
  resolves against whatever the checkout is at the instant it runs rather than
  against the paths you own. All three were paid for here:
  - `git commit` with no pathspec commits the whole INDEX, so it sweeps in
    whatever a peer had staged. One run put another agent's staged deletion into
    an unrelated commit. Always `git commit -- <explicit paths>`.
  - `git commit --only <path>` fails SILENTLY when the path is untracked — it
    prints `did not match any file(s)` and exits non-zero while a surrounding
    green build reports success. `git add` the file first.
  - `git commit --amend` amends whatever HEAD is NOW, which in a fleet is
    routinely a peer's commit landed seconds ago. One run rewrote a peer's
    message and folded two agents' work into one mislabelled commit. There is no
    pathspec that protects you: the target is implicit. If you need to fix a
    commit, add a follow-up commit instead.
- **Everything is scriptable**: every pact command accepts `--json` for
  machine-readable output; prefer it over parsing human-formatted text.

Run `pact doctor` if anything above seems out of date.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/core-concepts/sync-concepts.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.
